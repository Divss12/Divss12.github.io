<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>What does it take for a robotic car to see,
move around and think? And how are these abilities used in conjunction to
navigate an arena while avoiding obstacles? In this blog post, I will walk you
through a project where I programmed a robotic car to do these things: from
embedded programming allowing a microprocessor board to take the input from
infrared sensors and facilitate movement using motors, to using a pathfinding
algorithm to navigate the arena.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-US>The Problem</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We were provided with a robot car with a
STMicroelectronics Board, motors, IR distance sensors, a RaspberryPi and a camera
(some assembly of the components was required.) The goal? To have the robot
navigate an arena full of obstacles, scanning images with its camera and
reporting those images back to our android app. The second goal was a speed
test: to have the robot go around a large obstacle and make it back to its
starting location. Both competitions tested for speed and for accuracy.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-US>STM Part</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The first order of business was to assemble
the robot. The RaspberryPi, infrared sensors and camera were screwed onto the robot.
We soldered the wires required to ensure they wouldn’t fall off, and then we
got to programming. First, we established a way for the RaspberryPi to
communicate with the STM board using UART and with the android app using Bluetooth.
Then we worked with the team to come up with a protocol to pass messages
between these 3 components. Then we programmed a set of discrete movements the
robot could take, which chained together would be how the robot would navigate
the arena. We also configured the IR sensor as a failsafe to ensure the robot
would stop if it’s about to crash into an obstacle.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-US>Pathfinding Algorithm</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As we would know the locations of the obstacles
beforehand, we simply had to devise an algorithm for the robot to navigate the
entire arena as quick as possible. To do this, we broke down the problem into
graph-search problem. By dividing the arena into a 20x20 grid in which the
robot could be in any square in 4 possible orientations (North, South, East,
West); we can create a graph with 1600 nodes. Edges between these nodes represent
the different movements our robot could take changing its orientation and location.
After reducing the problem to a known problem (graph search), we were able to
simply apply Dijkstra’s algorithm and have the robot find its path around the
obstacles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>These are the 2 main parts I dealt with, my
team worked on other parts of the project. You can find more information in the youtube video below!</span></p>
